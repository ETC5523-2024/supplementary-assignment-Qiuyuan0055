First, loaded data conducted exploratory analysis contents, checking data completeness accuracy. Next, completed following work data preprocessing stage: Grouping cbp_resp data fiscal year demographic characteristics, calculating total number encounters group; cbp_state data grouped state calculate total number encounters state. addition, ensure reliability statistical results removing missing values (na.rm = TRUE) calculation. make data intuitive, designed two visualizations: first bar chart shows encounter trends fiscal year demographic characteristics; second horizontal bar chart compares total number encounters state. charts clearly show distribution patterns time space provide strong support analysis. # Results # Overall Trends Fiscal Year General Trends: Annual changes border encounters Analysis cbp_resp data reveals significant changes total number border encounters fiscal years, well trends distribution encounters across different demographic characteristics. Specifically, overall number encounters increased significantly fiscal years, phenomenon related policy changes global migration trends. example, years, number encounters unaccompanied children (UC) risen rapidly, indicating particular vulnerability group particular policy contexts. time, number recorded encounters family unit members (FMUA) adults (single persons) relatively stable, making majority border encounters. can see trends intuitively looking bar chart. data showed number encounters unaccompanied children increased rapidly given year, trend family unit members flat. changes can influenced number factors, changes border enforcement policies seasonal changes migration flows. #Encounter Counts State State distribution: Ranking border encounters state analysis cbp_state data, found significant regional differences geographical distribution border encounters. Texas’ total number encounters much higher states, showing importance major border state. phenomenon may driven long border Mexico concentration migrant flows. addition, California Arizona also occupy high positions total number encounters, demonstrating central role southern border states immigration management. hand, non-border states also show higher record encounters. states may host significant immigration detention facilities receive large numbers migrants transferred border states. phenomenon reflects fact management migration problem border areas, also involves coordination implementation policies within countries broadly. horizontal bar chart clearly shows number encounters state. can see chart, Texas ranks first wide margin, southern border states close behind. data provide valuable insights geographical distribution migration flows provide basis studying migration management needs different states.  analysis, found border encounter data contains multiple layers information, revealing important temporal spatial trends. time dimension, total number border encounters increased significantly years, possibly due combination immigration policy changes global migration crisis. example, rapid increase number unaccompanied children suggests group may sensitive policy adjustments changes external environment. Family unit members adults make bulk total number encounters, reflecting broader migration dynamics. perspective spatial distribution, southern border states occupy dominant position border management. Texas experienced largest number people, also likely major conduit flow migrants. southern states, California Arizona, similarly feature heavily total. addition, high number encounters non-border states also shows impact immigration management extends far beyond border region involve coordination immigration policy throughout country. Based findings, future research explore specific effects immigration policy, example analyzing impact policy changes particular demographic characteristic, studying seasonal patterns border encounters. addition, use machine learning methods predict future migration trends also important direction. studies can inform policy formulation, also help optimize existing immigration management frameworks.","code":"# Load data cbp_resp <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2024/2024-11-26/cbp_resp.csv') #> Rows: 68815 Columns: 12 #> ── Column specification ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── #> Delimiter: \",\" #> chr (10): month_grouping, month_abbv, component, land_border_region, area_of... #> dbl  (2): fiscal_year, encounter_count #>  #> ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. #> ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message. cbp_state <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2024/2024-11-26/cbp_state.csv') #> Rows: 54939 Columns: 9 #> ── Column specification ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── #> Delimiter: \",\" #> chr (7): month_grouping, month_abbv, land_border_region, state, demographic,... #> dbl (2): fiscal_year, encounter_count #>  #> ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. #> ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message. #
